TODO

0. add all currently unhalndled customisations: psql, browserproxy, aliases and other configs (this probably should go on top of this list)
0.1 make it possible to pull repo to any given folder and run it (now everything dependant on filesystem path for the repo... )
1. move config files to proper modules 
2. add proper dependencies as needed
3. add needed packages to the server module
4. add xmonad handling in workstation (allow for different github repos to be used as xmonad config backend as a extra bonus ;))
5. install.sh and run.sh should be examined (proviede proper modulepath etc)
6. dump packages as a command to be pasted later at boxes where puppet is not available (call it a puppet challange)
7. split further: init.pp into proper implementation files
8. create qa module (php related at the moment)
9. for workstation add firefox command line plugin installation if possible at all
10. learn how puppet tests work and add some 
11. low priority: try handlig enable for modules (except common)
